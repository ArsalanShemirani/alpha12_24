# Enhanced Max Pain Weighting System

## Overview
Successfully implemented an **advanced multi-factor max pain weighting system** that goes far beyond the basic distance-based approach. This system now considers 7 different factors to provide sophisticated confidence adjustments for trade setups.

## Enhanced Factors Analysis

### 1. **Distance to Max Pain Strike** (Basic Factor)
- **Calculation**: `abs(current_price - max_pain_strike) / current_price * 100`
- **Impact**: Normalized to 0-1 scale, influences direction multiplier
- **Example**: BTC at 115,422 vs max pain at 129,000 = 11.76% distance

### 2. **Time to Expiry Analysis** (New)
- **Logic**: Closer expiry dates have stronger max pain effects
- **Weighting**:
  - 0-7 days: 1.0 (strongest effect)
  - 8-30 days: 0.8 (close)
  - 31-90 days: 0.6 (medium)
  - 90+ days: 0.4 (weakest)
- **Implementation**: Parses Deribit expiry format (e.g., "27SEP24", "22AUG25")

### 3. **Open Interest Concentration** (New)
- **Calculation**: OI within ±5% of max pain strike / total OI
- **Impact**: Higher concentration = stronger max pain effect
- **Factor Range**: 0.9 to 1.1
- **Example**: 16.6% OI concentration near BTC max pain

### 4. **Volatility Skew (Put/Call Ratio)** (New)
- **Calculation**: Total put OI / total call OI
- **Impact**: PCR > 1.0 (bearish skew) vs PCR < 1.0 (bullish skew)
- **Factor Range**: 0.95 to 1.05
- **Example**: BTC PCR = 0.62 (bullish skew), ETH PCR = 0.42 (very bullish)

### 5. **Gamma Exposure Estimation** (New)
- **Calculation**: Simplified based on OI concentration near max pain
- **Impact**: Higher gamma = stronger price magnet effect
- **Factor Range**: 0.9 to 1.1
- **Example**: BTC gamma = 0.017, ETH gamma = 0.007

### 6. **Market Structure Analysis** (New)
- **Logic**: Very close to max pain = stronger structural support/resistance
- **Scoring**:
  - < 5% distance: 0.2 (strongest)
  - 5-10% distance: 0.1 (moderate)
  - 10-20% distance: 0.05 (weak)
  - > 20% distance: 0.0 (none)
- **Factor Range**: 0.95 to 1.05

### 7. **Direction Alignment** (Enhanced)
- **Logic**: Reward trades toward max pain, penalize trades against
- **Calculation**: `1.0 + (alignment * distance_factor * 0.15)`
- **Range**: ±15% maximum impact
- **Example**: BTC toward LONG, LONG trade = +8.8% boost

## Weight Calculation Formula

```
Final Weight = Direction_Weight + Total_Adjustment

Where:
Direction_Weight = 1.0 + (direction_alignment × distance_factor × 0.15)  # ±15% max
Total_Adjustment = expiry_adjustment + oi_adjustment + pcr_adjustment + gamma_adjustment + structure_adjustment

Adjustments (all very small):
- Expiry: ±1% max
- OI Concentration: ±2% max  
- Put/Call Ratio: ±1% max
- Gamma Exposure: ±1% max
- Market Structure: ±1% max
```

## Real-World Examples

### BTC Analysis (Current Data)
- **Max Pain Strike**: 129,000
- **Current Price**: 115,344
- **Distance**: 11.84%
- **Toward Direction**: LONG
- **OI Concentration**: 16.6%
- **Put/Call Ratio**: 0.62 (bullish skew)
- **Gamma Exposure**: 0.017
- **Weight Impact**: +8.7% (LONG aligned), -9.1% (SHORT opposed)

### ETH Analysis (Current Data)
- **Max Pain Strike**: 3,250
- **Current Price**: 4,308
- **Distance**: 24.55%
- **Toward Direction**: SHORT
- **OI Concentration**: 7.4%
- **Put/Call Ratio**: 0.42 (very bullish skew)
- **Gamma Exposure**: 0.007
- **Weight Impact**: -15.0% (LONG opposed), +14.2% (SHORT aligned)

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
MAXPAIN_ENABLE_WEIGHT=1          # Enable/disable max pain weighting
MAXPAIN_USE_ENHANCED=1           # Use enhanced vs basic calculation
MAXPAIN_DIST_REF_PCT=5.0         # Reference distance for scaling
MAXPAIN_WEIGHT_MAX=0.10          # Maximum weight impact (±10%)
```

### UI Configuration
```python
maxpain_enable_weight = True     # Enable in UI
maxpain_use_enhanced = True      # Use enhanced calculation
```

## Integration with Trade Setup Generation

### In `autosignal.py`

2. **Confidence Adjustment**: `confidence = confidence * sentiment_weight * maxpain_weight`
3. **Setup Records**: All max pain metrics stored in `setups.csv`
4. **Telegram Alerts**: Enhanced alerts with detailed max pain analysis
